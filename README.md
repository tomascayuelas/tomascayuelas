# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm TomÃ¡s Cayuelas

Working at [47 Degrees / Xebia functional](https://github.com/47deg) as a Software Engineer.

I mainly coding in Scala and Kotlin, but I try to always have these other languages ready:
 - Php
 - Rust
 - Python
 - Bash
 - Typescript/Javacript

Interested in multiple programming paradigms, especially functional programming. This is my main focus right now.
